| The number of bands has been changed from the values supplied in |
| the INCAR file. This is a result of running the parallel version. |
| The orbitals not found in the WAVECAR file will be initialized with |
| random numbers, which is usually adequate. For correlated |
| calculations, however, you should redo the groundstate calculation. |
| I found NBANDS = 4. Now, NBANDS = 64. |
