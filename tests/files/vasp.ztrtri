|     Possible solutions for this issue are:                                  |
|     - Please check whether the atoms are too close to each other.           |
|     - Decreasing POTIM might help during relaxations or MDs.                |
|     - Deleting CHGCAR or WAVECAR if incompatible with the structure.        |
|     - Try calculating without symmetrizing (ISYM = 0 or ISYM = -1).         |
|     - As last resort: using a different PAW for some of the atoms.          |
|                                                                             |
