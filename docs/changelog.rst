Change Log
==========

v0.7.6
------
1. Custodian is now Python 3 compatible and uses the latest versions of
   pymatgen and monty.

v0.7.5
------
1. **Major** Custodian now exits with RuntimeError when max_errors or
   unrecoverable_error is encountered.
2. Added BadVasprunXMLHandler.

v0.7.4
------
1. auto_npar option in VaspJob now properly handles Hessian calculations.
2. WalltimeHandler now supports termination at electronic step (David
   Waroquiers).
3. Improved handling of BRMIX fixes.

v0.7.3
------
1. Improved backwards compatibility for WallTimeHandler.
2. Improvements to VaspErrorHandler. No longer catches spurious BRMIX error
   messages when NELECT is specified in INCAR, and pricel and rot_mat errors
   are now fixed with symmetry precision and gamma centered KPOINTS instead.
3. Improved Qchem error handler (Xiaohui Qu).

v0.7.2
------
1. Improved WalltimeHandler (PBSWalltimeHandler is a subset and is now
   deprecated).
2. New monty required version (>= 0.2.2).

v0.7.1
------
1. Much improved qchem error handling (Xiaohui Qu).
2. New Monty required version (>= 0.2.0).

v0.7.0
------
1. **Backwards incompatible with v0.6.3. Refactoring to move commonly used
   Python utility functions to `Monty package <https://pypi.python
   .org/pypi/monty>`_, which is now a depedency
   for custodian.
2. Custodian now requires pymatgen >= 2.9.0 for VASP, Qchem and Nwchem jobs
   and handlers.
3. converge_kpoints script now has increment mode.
4. ErrorHandlers now have a new API, where the class variables "is_monitor"
   and "is_terminating" are provided to indicate if a particular handler
   runs in the background during a Job and whether a handler should
   terminate the job. Some errors may not be critical or may need to wait
   for some other event to terminate a job. For example,
   a particular error may require a flag to be set to request a job to
   terminate gracefully once it finishes its current task. The handler to
   set the flag should not terminate the job.

0.6.3
-----
1. Added buffer time option in PBSWalltimeHandler.
2. Improved Qchem jobs and handlers (Xiaohui Qu).
3. Vastly improved API docs.

0.6.2
-----
1. Bug fix release to support sub dirs in run folder when using scratch.
2. Improve handling of walltime in PBSWalltimeHander.

0.6.1
-----
1. Bug fix release to address minor issue with checkpointing.
2. Checkpointing is now turned off by default.

0.6.0
-----
1. Checkpointing implemented for Custodian. Custodian can now checkpoint all
   files in the current working directory after every successful job. If the
   job is resubmitted, it will restore files and start from the last
   checkpoint. Particularly useful for multi-job runs.
2. Added PBSWalltimeHandler to handle wall times for PBS Vasp Jobs.
3. Qchem error handlers and jobs.

0.5.0
-----
1. Added scratch_dir option to Custodian class as well as run_vasp and
   run_nwchem scripts. Many supercomputing clusters have a scratch space
   which have significantly faster IO. This option provides a transparent way
   to specify the jobs to be performed in the scratch. Especially useful for
   jobs which have significant file IO.

0.4.5
-----
1. Fix gzip of output.

0.4.3
-----
1. Added handling for ZBRENT error for VASP.
2. Minor refactoring to consolidate backup and gzip directory methods.

0.4.2
-----
1. Rudimentary support for Nwchem error handling (by Shyue Ping Ong).
2. Improved VASP error handling (by Steve Dacek and Will Richards).

0.4.1
-----
1. Added hanlding of PRICEL error in VASP.
2. Speed and robustness improvements.
3. BRIONS error now handled by changing ISYM.

0.4.0
-----
1. Many VASP handlers are now consolidated into a single VaspErrorHandler.
2. Many more fixes for VASP runs, including the "TOO FEW BANDS",
   "TRIPLE PRODUCT", "DENTET" and "BRIONS" errors.
3. VaspJob now includes the auto_npar and auto_gamma options, which
   automatically optimizes the NPAR setting to be sqrt(number of cores) as
   per the VASP recommendation for DFT runs and tries to search for a
   gamma-only compiled version of VASP for gamma 1x1x1 runs.

0.3.5
-----
1. Bug fix for incorrect shift error handler in VASP.
2. More robust fix for unconverged VASP runs (switching from ALGO fast to
   normal).
3. Expanded documentation.

0.3.4
-----
1. Added support for handlers that perform monitor a job as it is progressing
   and terminates it if necessary. Useful for correcting errors that come up
   by do not cause immediate job failures.

0.3.2
-----
1. Important bug fix for VaspJob and converge_kpoints script.

0.3.0
-----

1. Major update to custodian API. Custodian now perform more comprehensive
   logging in a file called custodian.json, which logs all jobs and
   corrections performed.

Version 0.2.6
-------------
1. Bug fix for run_vasp script for static runs.

Version 0.2.5
-------------
1. run_vasp script that now provides flexible specification of vasp runs.
2. Vastly improved error handling for VASP runs.
3. Improved logging system for custodian.
4. Improved API for custodian return types during run.
5. First stable release.

Version 0.2.4
-------------

1. Bug fixes for aflow style runs assimilation.
