# custodian.vasp.utils module

Utility methods for VASP error handlers.

## custodian.vasp.utils.increase_k_point_density(kpoints: Kpoints | dict | float, structure: Structure, factor: float = 0.1, max_inc: int = 500, min_kpoints: int = 1, force_gamma: bool = True)

Inputs:
: kpoints (Kpoints, dict, float, int) :
: If a dict or Kpoints object: original Kpoints used in the calculation
If a float: the original KSPACING used in the calculation
<br/>
structure (Structure) : associated structure
factor (float) : factor used to increase k-point density.
<br/>

> The first increase uses approximately (1 + factor) higher k-point density.
> The second increase: ~ (1 + 2\*factor) higher k-kpoint density, etc.
> max_inc (int)
> : before giving up
> <br/>
> min_kpoints (int): The minimum permitted number of k-points.
> : Can be useful if using the tetrahedron method, where
> at least 4 k-points are needed.
> <br/>
> force_gamma (bool) = True: whether to use Gamma-centered or
> : Monkhorst-Pack grids

Outputs:
: dict :
: The new Kpoints object / KSPACING consistent with constraints.
If an empty dict, no new k-point mesh could be found.
