 Number of energy points = 101
 Doing FMS for a cluster of 165 atoms around iph =  0
 Number of energy points = 101
* * * WARNING preparing cluster for FMS calculation.
      You specified a cluster of 172 atoms for the FMS calculation.
      This exceeds the hard wired limit of 165 atoms.
      The cluster size was reset to 165 and the calculation will continue.
