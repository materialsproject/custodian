Custodian is a simple, robust and flexible just-in-time (JIT) job management
framework written in Python. Using custodian, you can create wrappers that
perform error checking, job management and error recovery. It has a simple
plugin framework that allows you to develop specific job management workflows
for different applications.

Error recovery is an important aspect of many *high-throughput* projects that
generate data on a large scale. When you are running on the order of hundreds
of thousands of jobs, even an error-rate of 1% would mean thousands of errored
jobs that would be impossible to deal with on a case-by-case basis.

The specific use case for custodian is for long running jobs, with potentially
random errors. For example, there may be a script that takes several days to
run on a server, with a 1% chance of some IO error causing the job to fail.
Using custodian, one can develop a mechanism to gracefully recover from the
error, and restart the job with modified parameters if necessary.

The current version of Custodian also comes with two sub-packages for error
handling for Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) and NwChem
calculations.

Getting custodian
=================

Stable version
--------------

The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stable
release that will be hopefully, be relatively bug-free. The easiest way to
install custodian on any system is to use easy_install or pip, as follows::

    easy_install custodian

or::

    pip install custodian

Some plugins (e.g., vasp management) require additional setup (please see
`pymatgen's documentation <http://pymatgen.org/>`_).

Developmental version
---------------------

The bleeding edge developmental version is at the custodian's `Github repo
<https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian>`_. The developmental
version is likely to be more buggy, but may contain new features. The
Github version include test files as well for complete unit testing. After
cloning the source, you can type::

    python setup.py install

or to install the package in developmental mode::

    python setup.py develop

Requirements
============

Custodian requires Python 2.7+. There are no other required dependencies.

Optional dependencies
---------------------

Optional libraries that are required if you need certain features:

1. pymatgen 2.8.10+: To use the plugins for VASP, NwChem and Qchem. Please
   install using::

    pip install pymatgen

   For more information, please consult `pymatgen's documentation`_.
2. nose - For complete unittesting.

Usage
===========

Please refer to the `official custodian docs
<http://pythonhosted.org//custodian>`_ for details on how to use
custodian.
