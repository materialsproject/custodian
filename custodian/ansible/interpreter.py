class Modder:
    """
    Class to modify a dict/file/any object using a mongo-like language.
    Keywords are mostly adopted from mongo's syntax, but instead of $, an
    underscore precedes action keywords. This is so that the modification can
    be inserted into a mongo db easily.

    Allowable actions are supplied as a list of classes as an argument. Refer
    to the action classes on what the actions do. Action classes are in
    pymatpro.ansible.actions.

    Examples:
    >>> modder = Modder()
    >>> dct = {"Hello": "World"}
    >>> mod = {'_set': {'Hello':'Universe', 'Bye': 'World'}}
    >>> modder.modify(mod, dct)
    >>> dct['Bye']
    'World'
    >>> dct['Hello']
