    Estimate the number of k-points used by VASP.

    Inputs:
        structure (Structure): structure used in the calculation
        kspacing (float): KSPACING used in the calculation
    Returns:
        tuple[int,int,int] : the number of estimated k-points on each axis.

    Note that there is a typo in the VASP manual:
        https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/KSPACING
    The inner product between direct a_i and reciprocal b_i
    lattice vectors is conventionally a_i . b_j = 2 pi delta_ij

    That leads to an extra 2 pi factor in the expression for the
    number of k-points per axis from KSPACING. The formula used
    below has been checked for accuracy against VASP calculations.
